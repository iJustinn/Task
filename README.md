# Task

A privacy-focused iOS task manager built with SwiftUI. Kanban-style board with customizable groups, tags, working/due dates, and per-task reminders. Local-first via SwiftData with an iCloud sync upgrade path. Includes a home-screen widget for upcoming tasks.

Current app version: **0.1.0 (build 1)**

## Requirements

- iOS 18.0+
- Xcode 16.0+ (uses synchronized folder references)
- Swift 5 language mode

## Features

- **Kanban board** — horizontally scrollable groups. Defaults seed Daily, Weekly, Waiting, Doing, Pending, Done; users can rename, recolor, reorder (drag the colored pill header), add, and delete.
- **Editable board header** — tap the title and subtitle to rename; tap the emoji icon to pick from a 40-emoji curated set.
- **Cards**
  - Optional doc icon (when notes are non-empty)
  - Title
  - **Multi-line tag chips** that wrap to additional rows when too wide — the card auto-grows
  - Working date row (single day or range) and due date row, each blue when upcoming, red once arrived or passed
  - Per-column **Top 10 + "More +N"** pagination so a 100-card group doesn't render everything at once
- **Drag and drop** — drag a card to reorder within its column or onto another column to change status; drag a group's colored pill header onto another column to swap their positions. Uses `.move` operation (no green `+` badge), and the lifted preview is clipped to the card/pill shape.
- **Pull-to-refresh** on each column resets pagination back to 10 and re-renders, in case the UI ever feels stuck.
- **Custom calendar picker** — month grid; single-tap to set, tap selected day to clear. Toggle End Date in the Working Date sheet to pick a range — the start and end fill solid; the days between form a tinted strip (slightly shorter than the endpoints).
- **Local notifications** scheduled via `UNUserNotificationCenter`. Per-task Reminder toggle; default fires at 9 AM on the chosen date if no time is set.
- **Search** — the bottom-bar search field transforms when focused (the `+` and Settings buttons slide out, an `X` cancel slides in). Inline results replace the board, filtering by title, notes, tag names, and group names live.
- **Liquid Glass bottom nav** on iOS 26+ via `GlassEffectContainer` + `.glassEffect()`. iOS 18–25 falls back to the previous `.thinMaterial` design.
- **Settings**
  - **Appearance** — Theme, Language, Text Size, Group Width, App Accent, App Icon. Theme/Accent/Icon/etc. pickers all open as `[.medium, .large]` detent sheets.
  - **Default** — Card Order: choose how cards are sorted within every group.
    - *Sort By*: **Manual** (drag to order) · **Title** (alphabetical) · **Date** (smart: working date → due date → title, with sensible nil fallbacks)
    - *Order*: **Ascending** / **Descending** (disabled when Sort By is Manual)
  - **Customization** — Manage Groups, Manage Tags.
  - **Data** — iCloud Sync (Coming Soon), Manual Control → Export Data, Import Data (merges by ID then by name), Reset All Data.
  - **About** — How to Use (7 numbered guide cards), Feedback (mailto with prefilled body), Privacy, Disclaimer, Copyright, Version.
- **Every popup has both Cancel and Done** in its toolbar so users can confirm or back out consistently. Save-style sheets (Group Menu, Tag Edit, New Tag) keep their explicit Save / Add labels.
- **Confirmation popups** for every destructive action (Delete Task, Delete Group, Delete Tag, Reset All Data) — `ConfirmationSheet` with a tinted icon tile, title, message, and red Confirm / gray Cancel buttons.
- **Progress overlays** during Import and Export, plus a native iOS alert ("Import Successful" / "Export Successful") on completion.
- **Widget** — Upcoming Tasks home-screen widget (small / medium / large), reads a JSON snapshot from the App Group container shared with the main app.
- **Local-first** via SwiftData; schema designed for an iCloud sync toggle later (every property defaulted, no `.unique` constraints, optional inverse relationships).
- **Localization** — English + Simplified Chinese via `Localizable.xcstrings`.

## Build

1. Open `task.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the `Task` scheme.
3. Build and run on an iPhone simulator or device.

On first launch the app seeds six default groups and an editable board title.

## Data Format

Export produces JSON in this shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "exportedAt": "ISO-8601",
  "board": { "id", "title", "subtitle", "iconEmoji", "createdAt", "updatedAt" },
  "groups": [{ "id", "name", "colorKey", "sortIndex", "createdAt" }],
  "tags":   [{ "id", "name", "colorKey", "createdAt" }],
  "tasks":  [{
    "id", "title", "notes", "workingStart", "workingEnd", "dueDate",
    "hasReminder", "sortIndex", "createdAt", "updatedAt",
    "groupID", "tagIDs"
  }]
}
```

Import merges in this order:

1. **ID match** — same UUID → update in place.
2. **Name match** (groups and tags only, case-insensitive) — same name → update existing entity; the imported UUID is remapped to the existing record so referenced tasks/tags resolve correctly.
3. **Insert** — neither match → create a new entity with the imported UUID.

Existing entities not present in the imported file are preserved (non-destructive merge).

## Privacy

Task is local-first. Boards, groups, tags, tasks, and preferences live on-device via SwiftData. The widget reads a small JSON snapshot from the App Group container (`group.com.ijustin.task`). The app makes no network requests of its own. Notifications are scheduled locally only when a task's reminder is on. See **Settings → About → Privacy** in-app for the full breakdown.
